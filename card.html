			<p class="border">Ravelinde appears on every good party and dances like no one is watching. This behavior leads other party people to feel free and express themself without fear. To see and watch her, sometimes its necessary to close your eyes. When you met her once, you wish to met her on every party again. Getting in touch with her is a magical moment.</p>
